  The Schools Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey found in 2010 that the number of NSW children who were overweight or obese had risen from around one in 10 to one in 4 over a 20 year period. The level of obesity tripled in all age groups ¨C and for both boys and girls ¨C over the same period. One third of children ate confectionary at least three times a week. Over 50% of boys and girls who reported having soft drinks available at home consumed at least two cups a week. (https://www.healthykids.nsw.gov.au/stats-research/). These statistics show a distinctly high rate of poor decisions in regards to health and nutrition, with its effect directly resulting in an increase in overall obesity rates amongst children. 


  The Australian government is well aware of these issues, and have launched initiatives to educate parents on making smarter decisions towards their children's health. Such solutions are usually in the form of text-heavy information-based websites like https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/ and https://healthyweight.health.gov.au.  However, there seems to be a lack of focus on increasing kids' awareness of the benefits of fresh food so they can make better choices at an early age.
