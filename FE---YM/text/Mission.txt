  Our project directly targets children, typically those in primary school and early middle school. However, there is a residual target audience of parents and teachers to support their children's development. When it comes to health for children, it takes many to tango - since parents have the purchasing power and the school supports the growth of a child for large portions of their day.

  Our platform will aim to educate children on health and nutrition. From personal experience in the Australian education system - children are indeed taught this in health classes, but typically as a one-off discussion and with no structured long-term engagement plan in place. We will implement a mixed-media teaching format that is catered to the children's comprehension level. This teaching service will encompass an evaluation and reward system to track student's progress over time. The content will focus on healthy and unhealthy food choices and its effects on personal wellbeing, as well as suggested physical health topics. Evaluation will be conducted through a combination of quizzes and short games.
