  ## Research

  ### What are the different types of people suffering and are impacted by this problem?

  The Schools Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey found in 2010 that the number of NSW children who were overweight or obese had risen from around one in 10 to one in 4 over a 20 year period. The level of obesity tripled in all age groups – and for both boys and girls – over the same period. One third of children ate confectionary at least three times a week. Over 50% of boys and girls who reported having soft drinks available at home consumed at least two cups a week. (https://www.healthykids.nsw.gov.au/stats-research/). These statistics show a distinctly high rate of poor decisions in regards to health and nutrition, with its effect directly resulting in an increase in overall obesity rates amongst children. 

  ### Current Solutions

  The Australian government is well aware of these issues, and have launched initiatives to educate parents on making smarter decisions towards their children's health. Such solutions are usually in the form of text-heavy information-based websites like https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/ and https://healthyweight.health.gov.au.  However, there seems to be a lack of focus on increasing kids' awareness of the benefits of fresh food so they can make better choices at an early age. (https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/how-might-we-give-children-the-knowledge-to-eat-better/)

  ### Target Demographic

  Our project directly targets children, typically those in primary school and early middle school. However, there is a residual target audience of parents and teachers to support their children's development. When it comes to health for children, it takes many to tango - since parents have the purchasing power and the school supports the growth of a child for large portions of their day.

  ## Build Proposal

  We will develop an online platform called 'Hello Food'. This platform will nurture the nutritional and health awareness of children from an early age. The platform will draw a lot of inspiration from MOOC's like Coursera, Udemy and Udacity, while tailoring the educational experience to mimic sites like Khan Academy. Since this platform will primarily be designed for use by children, it must not be too content-heavy and must be very child-friendly. As well as helping children learn how to make better food and health choices, light-hearted inter-class and inter-school competitions will be enabled to allow continued tracking of individual improvement and impact of the platform over time.

  Our platform will aim to educate children on health and nutrition. From personal experience in the Australian education system - children are indeed taught this in health classes, but typically as a one-off discussion and with no structured long-term engagement plan in place. We will implement a mixed-media teaching format that is catered to the children's comprehension level. This teaching service will encompass an evaluation and reward system to track student's progress over time. The content will focus on healthy and unhealthy food choices and its effects on personal wellbeing, as well as suggested physical health topics. Evaluation will be conducted through a combination of quizzes and short games.

  Finally, to enable parent and teacher cooperation - a student management and enablement system will be implemented. Learning sections can be unlocked on a rolling basis by teacher accounts over a custom time period to enforce an learning pace for all students. Furthermore, children can track their healthy food consumption over the week, and request approval from their parent/teacher. A leaderboard system based on the healthy food consumption of the children will be available to teachers, so they can reward or congratulate the healthiest students at the end of the week. This is a form of positive reinforcement, and a method to motivate others in the class to make healthier choices. 

  ### Viability of the Solution

  In recent years, nearly all schools in Australia have begun incorporating some sort of online platform to assist and evaluate student's curriculum learning. 

  ### For example, students in **Queensland** may use the following websites:

  Literacy - *Word Flyers* - wordflyers.com.au

  Language - *Language Perfect* - educationperfect.com/subjects/languages

  Numeracy - *MathSpace* - mathspace.co/au

  Science - *Stile* - stileeducation.com

  Health - *None*

  ## 

  'Hello Food' aims to be a platform that is tailored to the health and physical education of students and should supplement a state curriculum like the other shown established platforms.
